# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The model utilizes a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, with considerations for techniques like oversampling or undersampling to improve results.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the code for this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🧠

## 📝 Usage & Settings
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handling missing values and scaling features.
2. **Class Imbalance Handling**: Address class imbalance issues using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
3. **Model Training**: Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) and train the model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.
5. **Performance Improvement**: Consider additional techniques like hyperparameter tuning or feature selection to improve model performance further.
